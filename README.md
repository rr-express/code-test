# Welcome!

Congratulations on your progress in the interview process! We're looking forward to seeing your submission.

## What We Look For

This is not an exam! We're primarily looking at how you approach problem solving and the patterns and practices you use prefer to use when writing code.

## Instructions

1. Use any programming language you are comfortable with. However, at R&R we predominantly use C#/React.
2. Complete the prompt as best you can, keeping in mind that you will not be penalized for missing or leaving parts of the prompt incomplete.
3. Focus on getting a small amount of working code, built to the standards you prefer.
4. Please provide instructions on how to run your project.
5. There is no time limit, but we recommend no longer than an hour or two.

# Prompt - Word Search

## Description

You'll be writing a simple word search game. To keep things simple, the word search will only include vertical and horizontal words. Diagonal words will not be included.

Use the following grid of letters:

```
L I O N F
B E A R D
I S H C A
R D T I T
F A C T S
```

The answer key is as follows:

- `LION`: first row, left to right
- `BEAR`: second row, left to right
- `FISH`: third row, left to right
- `BIRD`: fourth row, left to right
- `CAT`: third column, top to bottom

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Your application must start.
2. You must display the grid of letters.
3. You must display the words to search for.
4. A player must be able to select letters.
5. When a full word is selected, it must be highlighted within the grid.
6. As words are found, the app must keep track of which words are found and which are remaining.
